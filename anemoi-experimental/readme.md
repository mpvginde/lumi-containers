# Towards an anemoi container on LUMI
**In progress** 
We aime to construct a container that allows to have full anemoi functionality for development of a LAM MLWP model. 
Given the current in progress status of LAM in anemoi we will probably leave out some parts of anemoi that we expect to significantly evolve in the near future. These extra parts should be loaded in a virtual environment. We will probably include instructions/documentation on that environment here as well.
